# Decorator-builder for Autofac

The packages in this repository present an enhancement to the way in which developers using [Autofac] can register and resolve services/components which make use of the [decorator pattern]. Using these libraries, the registration and resolution of these services can be *clearer* and *more easily customizable* then using Autofac alone.

Please [read the project wiki] for more information.
